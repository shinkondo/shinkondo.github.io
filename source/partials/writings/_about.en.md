I am Shinnosuke Kondo. I finished my undergraduate education with a Computer Science degree, and will be working in a company in the Unite States. Naturally enough, my interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Regardless, I love programming and formatting (which is the reason I am writing this blog).

I am originally from Japan. Please do not be surprised at unfamiliar characters which may appear in this blog (such as 近藤伸之介, which is my name in Japanese). I often think about living in a foreign country. I may drop a post or two about my life, my philosophy, things like that.
  
If you would like to know about the meaning of the title, simply google it.
  
Oh, and I love :turtle:.  :penguin: is my second favorite, :sheep: third. 
  
## Environment
I own a Windows 7 laptop. My favorite editor for now is Sublime Text 3, though I like emacs, too. I run must of my code via cygwin.
  
## Update
My recent interest is in blogging using Jekyll.
