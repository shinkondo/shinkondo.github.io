Although I have not been urged to use, I decided to itegrte MathJax to my blog.

## Instillation
Installation was easy. Just to put the script in somewhere to read code from CDN. Although I am using Jekyll, I suppose that this could work with almost any web framework.

```html
<script type="text/javascript"
    src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>
```

## Examples
[Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html), the default MarkDown parser for Jekyll supports LaTeX math provided by MathJax.

Of course, if you correctly escape notations, any expression work, but as long as you stick to what is supported by the parser, the only things you need to use are two `$$`.

### Display Math

Although it is unlikely that I would write about something as mathematic as it, here is an example of a "block" math:

$$e^{\pi i}= 1$$

Code for it is as follows:

```latex
$$e^{\pi i}= 1$$
```

### Inline Math

But it is quite possble that I would argue about, say, the order of a specific functino. For example, <q>It is known that the expected order of _quick sort_ is $$O(n\cdot\log n)$$.</q>

```latex
<q>... is $$O(n\cdot\log n).</q>$$
```

### Things to Check

- Equation numbers and reference
- Complicated structures like matrices, cases, etc.
