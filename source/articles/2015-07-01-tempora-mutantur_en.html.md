## How I found it

It is not the meaning how I found this quotation. I was simply looking for some Latin phrase which contains the word "nos," which means "we" or "us." Well, again, meaning does not matter. I was particular about the word because my name, Shinnosuke contains "nos" in it. And I thought something Latin should be a good name for my new blog because 

1. A foreign phrase always sounds cool
2. But natives would laugh at you because it is hard to pick an appropriate foreign phrase (just imagine someone wearing a T-shirt with crazy English phrases).
3. There are only few, if any, native speakers of Latin.
4. So it is cool.

In any case, I googled with "nos Latin quote" and this one popped up as the first one.

## The World of Latin

My Latin teacher started a semester with questions about what students would use Latin for. The answers are... Well, you can take a guess. There were a bunch of practical answers: to remember biological terms, to make it help for mastering Latin related languages, not to learn phrases like "where is a bathroom?" while fulfilling the foreign language requirement, so on and so forth.

In contrast, he ended the semester with his opinion that Latin is only useful for accessing Latin readings. My feeling then was kind of disappointment. Spending fair amount of time, I knew that my Latin was not good enough for any practical purposes. (It is quite natural; if you want to remember biology terms, studying them is by far more efficient than spending time on classes which may or may not cover a few stems of those terms.) And I was not interested in something written in Latin so much either. In short, there was no use of my poor Latin skill.

However, I was wrong to measure benefits of education too early. The time I spent for it nurtured my sense of intimacy to Latin, which have helped me not to avoid Latin phrases I have found in my life. Although <q>tempora mutantur</q> is not a classical phrase, it carries one of the major ideas in Latin literature; we human live a life, and we are in transition. Phrases like <q>carpe diem</q> (not YOLO) and <q>memento mori</q> carry such an idea. I must thank the teacher for opening a way to an old, but new world for me.
