I got an error when I was running Jekyll as a gulp task. I installed Jekyll on Cygwin, and I got gulp using npm over node.js which I installed on Windows 7 natively. No wonder, the difference of the systems was the cause.

## None of Gulp Task Runs
As I was trying out several framework, I found `browser-sync` very useful in Google Web Starter Kit. I decided to use it for my blog made with Jekyll. As a reference, I looked up [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync) for install modules and gulp tasks. But when I ran `gulp jekyll-build`, I got this error.

```sh

## Windows Cannot Find File Without Extention
[Running jekyll as a child process in Gulp/Node](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21856861/running-jekyll-as-a-child-process-in-gulp-node) almost gave me the answer. This error occurs when gulp could not find the command. Unfortunately, maybe because I installed jekyll on cygwin, there was no `jekyll.bat` to replace `jekyll`. I decided to call ruby instead as follows:

```javascript
cp.spawn('ruby', ['<path to jekyll>', 'build'], {stdio: 'inherit'})
```

instead of

```js
cp.spawn('<path to jekyll>', ['build'], {stdio: 'inherit'})
```

It might be painful to update `gulpfile.js` everytime I update jekyll, but this would be easier and cleaner than adding something to PATH of Windows, as long as I stick to one project. And the problem is, even if it is added to the path, Windows would not excute a file without extension.

P.S. Installing node modules did not go well either (with gulp-sass). I decided to adapt package.json from Google Web Starter Kit(WSK) rather than to use the one from [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync). It seemed like some of the packages from WSK were implicitly prerequisite for gulp-sass. Anyway, it worked with WSK.
