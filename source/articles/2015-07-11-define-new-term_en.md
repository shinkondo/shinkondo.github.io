It is odd that some established notions (e.g. a lesson from your life which seems general) do not have terms associated with them. What are such notions? Who would, and how can the person name them?

## Examples of such notions without names

### The answer for the question lies among more than one layers
"Biopsychosociology" is defined as follows:

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model">
  <p>that biological, psychological (which entails thoughts, emotions, and behaviors), and social (socio-economical, socio-environmental, and cultural) factors, all play a significant role in human functioning in the context of disease or illness.</p>
  <footer> Wikipedia, <cite>Biopsychosocial model</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

I personally think that it has much wider domain than "the context of disease or illness," but in any case, this term obviously falls in the notion I described. Why do I need a term for something that contains well-defined term already? My answer is that because it is too specific.

Cases like a child with developmental problem ends up as a genius are explained well with "biopsychosociology." Maybe he has a biological tweaked brain, which gives him a particular psychological preference. And his generous parents accept it, providing a good sociological environments, which resulted in his academic success.

However, it is clear that a similar thing can be said for matters in many other fields. In Japan, for example, there is inconsistency between academic years and one's birth date.

## どうやって命名して、広めていけばよいのか。
まず、適当な呼称を思いつくのが並大抵のことではない。名付けと似通っているようで、考えなければいけないことが多すぎるし、何より寿命が長い。
